## Developing with Clarinet

## Hello World

[x] Create a new Clarinet project <br>
[x] Add a new Clarity contract to the project <br>
[x] Populate the contract with 2 types of functions <br>
[x] Execute the functions in a local, simulated blockchain <br>
[x] Optionally, deploy and test the contract on the testnet blockchain <br>

## Counter

[x] Add a new Clarity contract to the project <br> 
[x] Populate the contract with a variable and read variable function <br>
[x] Populate the contract with an increment and a decrement function <br>
[x] Execute the functions in a local, simulated blockchain <br>
[x] Optionally, deploy and test the contract on the testnet blockchain <br>

## Billboard

[x] Set up a development environment with Clarinet <br>
[x] Define codes for error handling <br>
[x] Add a data storage variable with functions to get and set the variable <br>
[x] Add a STX transfer function within the variable setter <br>
[x] Develop a unit test to verify the contract works as expected <br>

## Non-fungible tokens

[x] Create a new Clarinet project <br>
[x] Add contracts to the project, and set dependencies for those contracts <br>
[x] Define an NFT contract based on the SIP-009 standard <br>
